# Smart-Waiter
Smart Waiter is a food cart that can be used in Busy Restaurants to serve food from kitchen to customer table.
We considered a restaurant scenario for the project which has been attached in the project folder.

In simple, the algorithm of the robot:
1. Chef will put the food in trolley container, set a pin and table number.
2. Chef will also input a recommended temperature for the food. If the temperature inside the container is not matched with the input, it will alert with a buzzer.
3. Robot will take the food to that specific table.
4. If there is any obstacle on the way, it will alarm with buzzer.
5. Customer will be able to take the food out of trolley container providing the correct pin.
6. Then the robot will return to kitchen again.
